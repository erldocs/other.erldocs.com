<div class="description">
<p>plists is a drop-in replacement for module
 <url href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/lists.html">lists</url>, 
making most list operations parallel. It can operate on each element in 
parallel, for IO-bound operations, on sublists in parallel, for 
taking advantage of multi-core machines with CPU-bound operations, and 
across erlang nodes, for parallizing inside a cluster. It handles 
errors and node failures. It can be configured, tuned, and tweaked to 
get optimal performance while minimizing overhead.</p>

 <p>Almost all the functions are 
identical to equivalent functions in lists, returning exactly the same 
result, and having both a form with an identical syntax that operates on 
each element in parallel and a form which takes an optional "malt", 
a specification for how to parallize the operation.</p>

 <p>fold is the one exception, parallel fold is different from linear fold. 
This module also include a simple mapreduce implementation, and the 
function runmany. All the other functions are implemented with runmany, 
which is as a generalization of parallel list operations.</p>

 <em><marker id="Malts">Malts</marker></em><p> 
A malt specifies how to break a list into sublists, and can optionally 
specify a timeout, which nodes to run on, and how many processes to start 
per node.</p>

 <p>Malt = MaltComponent | [MaltComponent]<br />
 MaltComponent = SubListSize::integer() | {processes, integer()} |
 {timeout, Milliseconds::integer()} | {nodes, [NodeSpec]}<br /> 
NodeSpec = Node::atom() | {Node::atom(), NumProcesses::integer()}</p>

 <p>An integer can be given to specify the exact size for 
sublists. 1 is a good choice for IO-bound operations and when 
the operation on each list element is expensive. Larger numbers 
minimize overhead and are faster for cheap operations.</p>

 <p>If the integer is omitted, and 
you have specified a {processes, X}, the list is 
split into X sublists. This is only 
useful when the time to process each element is close to identical and you 
know exactly how many lines of execution are available to you.</p>

 <p>If neither of the above applies, the sublist size defaults to 1.</p>

 <p>You can use {processes, X} to have the list processed 
by X processes on the local machine. A good choice for X is the number of 
lines of execution (cores) the machine provides.</p>

 <p>{timeout, Milliseconds} specifies a timeout. This is a timeout for the entire 
operation, both operating on the sublists and combining the results. 
exit(timeout) is evaluated if the timeout is exceeded.</p>

 <p>{nodes, NodeList} specifies that the operation should be done across nodes. 
Every element of NodeList is of the form {NodeName, NumProcesses} or 
NodeName, which means the same as {NodeName, 1}. plists runs 
NumProcesses process on NodeName concurrently. A good choice for 
NumProcesses is the number of lines of execution (cores) a machine provides 
plus one. This ensures the machine is completely busy even when 
fetching a new sublist. plists is able to recover if a node goes down. 
If all nodes go down, exit(allnodescrashed) is evaluated.</p>

 <p>Any of the above may be used as a malt, or may be combined into a list. 
{nodes, NodeList} and {processes, X} may not be combined.</p>

 <em><marker id="Examples">Examples</marker></em><p>
 % start a process for each element (1-element sublists)<br /> 
1</p>

 <p>% start a process for each ten elements (10-element sublists)<br /> 
10</p>

 <p>% split the list into two sublists and process in two processes<br /> 
{processes, 2}</p>

 <p>% split the list into 10-element sublists and process in two processes<br /> 
[10, {processes, 2}]</p>

 <p>% timeout after one second. Assumes that a process should be started<br />
 % for each element.<br /> 
{timeout, 1000}</p>

 <p>% Runs 3 processes at a time on apple@desktop,
 and 2 on orange@laptop<br />
 % This is the best way to utilize all the CPU-power of a dual-core<br />
 % desktop and a single-core laptop. Assumes that the list should be<br />
 % split into 1-element sublists.<br /> 
{nodes, [{apple@desktop, 3}, {orange@laptop, 2}]}</p>

 <p>% Gives apple and orange three seconds to process the list as<br />
 % 100-element sublists.<br /> 
[100, {timeout, 3000}, {nodes, [{apple@desktop, 3}, {orange@laptop, 2}]}]</p>

 <em><marker id="Aside:_Why_Malt?">Aside: Why Malt?</marker></em><p> 
I needed a word for this concept, so maybe my subconsciousness gave me one by 
making me misspell multiply. Maybe it is an acronym for Malt is A List 
Tearing Specification. Maybe it is a beer metaphor, suggesting that code 
only runs in parallel if bribed with spirits. It's jargon, learn it 
or you can't be part of the in-group.</p>

 <em><marker id="Messages_and_Errors">Messages and Errors</marker></em><p> 
plists assures that no extraneous messages are left in or will later 
enter the message queue. This is guaranteed even in the event of an error.</p>

 <p>Errors in spawned processes are caught and propagated to the calling 
process. If you invoke</p>

 <p>plists:map(fun (X) -&gt; 1/X end, [1, 2, 3, 0]).</p>

 <p>you get a badarith error, exactly like when you use lists:map.</p>

 <p>plists uses monitors to watch the processes it spawns. It is not a good idea 
to invoke plists when you are already monitoring processes. If one of them 
does a non-normal exit, plists receives the 'DOWN' message believing it to be 
from one of its own processes. The error propagation system goes into 
effect, which results in the error occuring in the calling process.</p>

<div class="function">
<h3 id="fold/5">fold(Fun, Fuse, InitAcc, List, Malt) -&gt; term()</h3>


<div class="description">

<p>fold is more complex when made parallel. There is no foldl and foldr, 
accumulators aren't passed in any defined order. 
The list is split into sublists which are folded together. Fun is 
identical to the function passed to lists:fold[lr], it takes 
(an element, and the accumulator) and returns -&gt; a new accumulator. 
It is used for the initial stage of folding sublists. Fuse fuses together 
the results, it takes (Results1, Result2) and returns -&gt; a new result. 
By default sublists are fused left to right, each result of a fuse being 
fed into the first element of the next fuse. The result of the last fuse 
is the result.</p>

 <p>Fusing may also run in parallel using a recursive algorithm,
 by specifying the fuse as {recursive, Fuse}. See
 the discussion in <a href="#runmany/4" class="seealso">runmany/4</a>.</p>

 Malt is the malt for the initial folding of sublists, and for the
 possible recursive fuse.

<div class="description">

<p>This is a very basic mapreduce. You won't write a Google-rivaling
 search engine with it. It has no equivalent in lists. Each
 element in the list is run through the MapFunc, which produces either
 a {Key, Value} pair, or a lists of key value pairs, or a list of lists of
 key value pairs...etc. A reducer process runs in parallel with the mapping
 processes, collecting the key value pairs into a
 <url href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/dict.html">dict</url>. This dict 
is returned as the result.</p>

 <p>MapMalt is the malt for the mapping operation, with a default value of 1, 
meaning each element of the list is mapped by a seperate process.</p>

 mapreduce requires OTP R11B, or it may leave monitoring messages in the
 message queue.

<h3 id="runmany/4">runmany(Fun, Fuse, List, Malt) -&gt; term()</h3>

<ul class="type">
<li><code>Fun = (list()) -&gt; term()</code></li><li><code>Fuse = FuseFunc | {recursive, FuseFunc}</code></li><li><code>FuseFunc = (term(), term()) -&gt; term()</code></li></ul>
<div class="description">

<p>All of the other functions are implemented with runmany. runmany 
takes a List, splits it into sublists, and starts processes to operate on 
each sublist, all done according to Malt. Each process passes its sublist 
into Fun and sends the result back.</p>

 <p>The results are then fused together to get the final result. There are two 
ways this can operate, lineraly and recursively. If Fuse is a function, 
a fuse is done linearly left-to-right on the sublists, the results 
of processing the first and second sublists being passed to Fuse, then 
the result of that fuse and processing the third sublits, and so on. 
This method preserves the original order of the lists elements.</p>

 <p>To do a recursive fuse, pass Fuse as {recursive, FuseFunc}. 
The recursive fuse makes no guarantee about the order the results of 
sublists, or the results of fuses are passed to FuseFunc. It 
continues fusing pairs of results until it is down to one.</p>

 <p>Recursive fuse is down in parallel with processing the sublists, and a 
process is spawned to fuse each pair of results. It is a parallized 
algorithm. Linear fuse is done after all results of processing sublists 
have been collected, and can only run in a single process.</p>

 Even if you pass {recursive, FuseFunc}, a recursive fuse is only done if
 the malt contains {nodes, NodeList} or {processes, X}. If this is not the
 case, a linear fuse is done.
