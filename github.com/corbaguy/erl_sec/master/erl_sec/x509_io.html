<div class="description">

<p>   Given a file or directory path, returns a list of records of type
           <a href="x509.html#type-certificate" class="seealso">x509:certificate()</a> representing all of the identifiable,           
unencrypted X.509 certificates at or below the specified Path.</p>
 
   <p>The returned certificates HAVE NOT been verified in any way beyond
   successfully parsing them.  See <a href="#read_cert_file/1" class="seealso">read_cert_file/1</a> for details   
about how each located file is evaluated and parsed.</p>
 
   <p>Duplicates are removed from the result set, but otherwise NO ordering is   
assured.</p>
 
   <p>If the operation cannot be completed successfully, an error is raised,
   most likely containing one of the <a href="file.html#type-posix" class="seealso">file:posix()</a> reasons and, if
   you're lucky, possibly the path where the error occurred.

   <p>Filename extensions are considered as follows, regardless of case:</p>
 
   <p>Files with extension ".der" are assumed to be binary DER-encoded

   <p>Files with extension ".pem" are assumed to be PEM-encoded, and any   
entities identified as certificates are decoded.</p>
 
   <p>Files with extension ".key" are assumed to be private keys, in any format,

   <p>All other files are first parsed as binary DER-encoded certificates,
