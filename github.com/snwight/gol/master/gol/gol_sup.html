<p>    
from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life       
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional       
orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two       
possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its       
eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally,       
vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the       
following transitions occur:</p>
 
       <p>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if       
caused by under-population.       
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the       
next generation.       
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if       
by overcrowding.       
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live       
cell, as if by reproduction.</p>
 
       <p>The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system.       
The first generation is created by applying the above rules       
simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur       
simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is       
sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure       
function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied       
repeatedly to create further generations.</p>
 
   <p>...that said, this implementation actually allows any BX/SX ruleset</p></div>
